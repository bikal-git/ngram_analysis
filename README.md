#Customer Support Chat N-Gram Analysis

##Overview

This project analyzes a simulated customer support chat using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The script extracts and visualizes the most common bigrams and trigrams in the conversation, providing insights into frequently occurring phrases in customer interactions.

##Features

Preprocesses text by removing punctuation and converting it to lowercase.

Tokenizes customer chat messages.

Extracts bigrams and trigrams from the conversation.

Counts and visualizes the most frequent n-grams using bar plots.

Provides textual output of the most common bigrams and trigrams.

##Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pip install nltk matplotlib seaborn

##Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
cd repository-name

Run the notebook:

python script.py

The script will generate bar plots for the most common bigrams and trigrams in the conversation.

Output

Visualizations: Bar charts displaying the most common bigrams and trigrams.

Text Output: A printed list of the most frequent bigrams and trigrams.
